# Insider Backend – Football League Simulation (Go + Gin)

A lightweight backend that **simulates a 4-team Premier-League-style mini-league**, updates the table week-by-week, and estimates championship probabilities via Monte-Carlo after Week 4.

## 🚀 Features
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Simulation** | Plays 6 weeks (double round-robin) based on team strengths. |
| **Interface-based design** | `TeamService`, `MatchService` interfaces + concrete services (`MyTeamService`, `MyMatchService`). |
| **Struct composition** | Services embed `*sql.DB` and depend on interfaces, not concrete types. |
| **Monte-Carlo champion odds** | 15 000 simulations of the remaining schedule; results rounded to one decimal. |
| **Result editing** | `/change-match-result` reverts old stats, applies new score, recalculates table + probabilities. |
| **Reset helpers** | `/reset-teams`, `/reset-matches` for a clean slate. |
| **Postman ready** | Full collection supplied for quick testing. |
